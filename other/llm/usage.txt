Why is this significant: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators? From this website, the whole sample of countries (266) and years (1960 to 2020) is selected. Country level GDP per capita (constant and current LCU) is derived from three variables available at this website: GDP in 2010USD (gdp_2010usd), GDP in current USD (gdp_currentusd) and populaPon (pop). GDP per capita (USD) is the raPo of gdp_2010usd over pop and GDP per capita (current) is the result of gdp_currentusd over pop. Notes: i) not all GDP/populaPon observaPons were available for all 266 countries since 1960; ii) noPce GDP in 2010USD is not available in the current link (2020), but it was available in the version from 2018.

Data Source: World Development Indicators

The data used in this study is sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database, accessible through the following link: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators. This database encompasses a comprehensive sample of 266 countries and spans from the year 1960 to 2020.

Variables and Calculation of GDP per Capita:

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, both in constant and current local currency units (LCU), is derived from three key variables available within the database:

GDP in 2010 USD (gdp_2010usd)
GDP in current USD (gdp_currentusd)
Population (pop)
GDP per capita (USD) is calculated as the ratio of gdp_2010usd to population, providing a measure of economic output per person adjusted for inflation. Meanwhile, GDP per capita (current) is calculated as the result of dividing gdp_currentusd by population, offering a snapshot of economic output per person in current currency values.

Significance:

This dataset is significant for several reasons:

Longitudinal Coverage: With data spanning from 1960 to 2020, this dataset offers a comprehensive longitudinal perspective, enabling researchers to analyze economic trends and developments over an extensive time period.

Global Scope: Covering 266 countries, this dataset provides a broad and inclusive sample, allowing for cross-national comparisons and analyses of economic performance across diverse geographical regions.

Key Economic Indicators: By incorporating variables such as GDP and population, this dataset facilitates the assessment of economic growth, development, and welfare indicators at the country level.

Methodological Transparency: The detailed explanation of how GDP per capita is derived from the available variables enhances the transparency and reproducibility of the analysis, ensuring robustness in the research findings.

In summary, the World Development Indicators dataset from the World Bank serves as a valuable resource for researchers and policymakers alike, offering rich insights into global economic dynamics and trends over time.
